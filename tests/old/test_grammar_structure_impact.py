Test Grammar Checking Impact on Content Structure

the structural integrity of PAA and FAQ sections, similar to the 
humanization issues we discovered and fixed.

### What are the benefits of outdoor living for cats?
Outdoor living provides cats with natural enrichment, exercise opportunities, and the ability to express hunting instincts in a controlled environment.

### How can I keep my outdoor cat safe from predators?
Install secure fencing, provide elevated shelters, and consider supervised outdoor time during daylight hours when predators are less active.

### What are the best practices for transitioning indoor cats to outdoor living?
Start with supervised outdoor sessions, gradually increase exposure time, and ensure all vaccinations are current before allowing unsupervised access."""
