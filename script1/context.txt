The BMW i8 (I12/I15) is a plug-in hybrid sports car produced by BMW in Leipzig, Saxony. A total of 20,465 units have been produced. The production i8 was designed by Benoit Jacob, while the 2011 i8 Concept was designed by Richard Kim. It is classified as an S-segment sports car and is available in coupe (2-door) and roadster body styles. It features a transverse mid-engine layout with all-wheel drive and butterfly doors, sharing some features with the BMW i3.

The i8 is powered by a B38K15T0 1.5L turbocharged I3 gasoline engine and an electric motor. It uses an Aisin F21-360 FT EOP transverse 6-Speed Automatic Transmission. The battery is a lithium-ion battery with 11.6 kWh for 2018-2020 model years. The car can operate as a pure-gasoline or pure-electric vehicle, though running on gas only is not eco-friendly.

The i8's system output has increased to 374hp. The combined output of the engine and electric motor is 369 horsepower. It achieves 600 km (370 mi) range in Eco Pro mode (NEDC) and 530 km (330 mi) (EPA). The electric range is 53–55 km (33–34 mi) (NEDC) for 2018 – 2020 model years and 24 km (15 mi) (EPA). For 2019 – 2020 model years, the EPA electric range is 29 km (18 mi).

The BMW i8 combines a sleek and aerodynamic design with advanced technology. The interior has a digital dash and LED lights. Some models have laser lights. The electric engine provides instant torque with no lag. The fake engine sound is impressive and especially younger people are more impressed about the ability to run silent on electric only.
