## Not Prioritized Issues (For Future Consideration)

- ðŸ”² RAG related issues:
  - Cloudflare URL access error
  - Unused parameter: rag_openrouter_model
  - Number of scraped URLs control

## New work

1. Exclude headings from processing - only apply functions to the content of sections, not to the headings themselves

2. Process content paragraph by paragraph within each section rather than processing entire sections at once 

3. Avoid running the functions on summary, titles and block notes / key takeaways

4. âœ… **COMPLETED**: There's a problem where even though we are changing the parameters that control content generation (size_headings and size_sections), as well as the paragraphs_per_section parameter, the system still seems to be generating a fixed number of paragraphs (approximately five) per section. We need to investigate why this is happening and identify where this value might be hard-coded in the system, as the parameters in script one aren't having the expected effect on the output.
