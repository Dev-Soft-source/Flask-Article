Automatically back off on 429 errors
Wrap your calls with a retry decorator that adds exponential backoff and jitter. Using the tenacity library.

2.)Wordpress API Connection, Missing Setup Features //BOTH SCRIPT//
Merge for all scripts the same way to API login via .env file or main.py only for all WP details
Fix User Login For Script1(There not option to post with different other selected users just with only first one admin)
Add Category Option (Category ID; default to uncatagorized) for script1
Add Option to choose post status - draft,published,pending review (draft is set up as default only)
Add Wordpress URL Link when Article post is successfully posted if it’s possible to add into script or list of url link address after finish script.
3.)Fix Grammar Tool (Humanization Work Only) //SCRIPT 1//
✅ FIXED: Error in grammar checking: RetryError[<Future at 0x2a4e2c8fd50 state=finished raised KeyError>]
2.)Add sequence option when is humanization and language tool turned as true for both //BOTH SCRIPT//
✅ FIXED: first run humanization then run language tool (language correction) if user use both features.
As far as this is possible and doesn't require huge interventions in the code and the whole functioning for both scripts.
3.)How to prevent long subtitles //SCRIPT 1 ONLY//
Is there any way how to avoid to hallucination of this in script1, please?

Add Option to prevent use the same images at the same article; use only one image from unsplash search per article
6.)Control How many titles are scraped at max for PAA
How can we edit and modify the maximum number of questions that is collected in the PAA section using SERPAPI. Is there any possibility of checking or editing?
🔒

Is default value set up for 5? Is possible to set up random value from 3-10 or zero if there’s no answer?

Enable option for title craft with prompt by true or false. When is enabled

SCRIPT2 ONLY
1.Time of produce article
Article creation with script 2 is too long. In average it takes 7 minutes to create with 2 subtitles
I have a feeling that there are some unnecessary functions in the code that increase the production time of the whole article, for example the creation of the structure of the whole article, which is not used in the end - “Outline creation”
Reduce the time to produce articles using script number2. The time to produce one article is too long due to the minimal amount of subheadings that the user specifies in the input.csv file
I think that it is working now in the latest version I noticed that outline creation is used in process. Maybe just a check it and remove it.
4subs(no rag)
Model
Average time to produce
Note
1
google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free
6-12 mins
+ PAA
2
mistralai/mistral-nemo:free
1-3 mins
- PAA
3
deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free
4-10 mins
- PAA
2. Parse CSV file
If we put more than one line for article creation is done without any issue if all articles contains the same number of subtitles.

As you can see there are two lines - two articles with 3x Subtitles. It work without issue.
🔒
Image
But when I tried to add various number subtitles for each article - for each line it stuck and comes with error.
Q : Is possible to edit way of parse of csv file from subtitle1 - subtitle15 even if every line contains different amount of subtitles. Example 1st article have 3 subtitles ; 2nd article have 5subtitles ; 3rd article have 1 subtitle. Maybe some kind of error handling for this case.
🔒
Image
In this case is not possible to parse and go on in script produce on the same amount of subtitles.
🔒
Image
The same amount of subtitles working smooth.
3.Language Tool
Language feature does’t work in script 2
4.PAA titles removed when is humanization enabled
- Often happen that there’s no used scraped titles (headings) from Google Serp. Script just create paragraphs. Note: I think that it is caused when is humanization feature enabled.

5.Fix to prefix url
Fix way how to script 2 produce prefix to use just long-tail keyword not full article title. In caase of duplication use numbers.

6.My Windows MS Visual Code issue with libraries (if there’s any possibility to solve this).
I have to manual install rich + dotenv libraries then other libraries without certain version (==x.y.z) from requirements.txt file to be able run Script2 on Windows. When I install the latest versions of the libraries it worked. Maybe conflict of libraries or missing necessary libraries for windows
Not priority for fix this. You can skip this point.
7.What does it mean when script hit the limit with tokens?
🔒
Image
Or any potential issues which can cause longer time for produce article?

8.Why we need to use openai in this case and library tiktoken and encoding?

Serious problem with subtitles when script create repetitive paragraphs.
When you want to get longer article and create more sections with more than 4 sections or paragraphs then script goes crazy and produce repetitive sentences.
🔒

Example when I tried to produce longer paragraphs:

Look at paragraphs then are almost identical and the same. For this generation I used deepseek/deepseek-chat:free LLM model and even other works the same way. Script 2 works only up to sections. In this case I haven’t used even RAG.
In this article was used also RAG:
