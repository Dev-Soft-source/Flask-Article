Alhamdulillah! I completely understand what you're saying. Let me break it down clearly:

## Understanding Script 2 Requirements

**Key Difference**: Script 2 uses CSV input where you manually provide main section titles, unlike Script 1 which generates everything automatically.

### What You Need in Script 2:

1. **CSV Input Structure**: You provide main section titles manually
2. **Dynamic Outline Generation**: Based on the CSV section titles, generate:
   - **If subsections > 0**: Generate subsection titles + their paragraph points (3-level hierarchy)
   - **If subsections = 0**: Generate only paragraph points for the main section (2-level hierarchy)

### Hierarchical Structure Support Needed:

**3-Level Hierarchy** (when subsections > 0):
```
CSV Section Title (h2) → Generated Subsections (h3) → Generated Paragraph Points
```

**2-Level Hierarchy** (when subsections = 0):
```
CSV Section Title (h2) → Generated Paragraph Points
```

## Plan for Script 2 Updates

### Phase 1: Outline Generation Updates
- [ ] Modify outline generation to use CSV section titles as base
- [ ] Generate subsections and paragraph points based on CSV titles
- [ ] Handle both 2-level and 3-level hierarchy based on subsections parameter

### Phase 2: Content Generation Updates  
- [ ] Update `generate_section` function to work with CSV-provided titles
- [ ] Modify section_points extraction to use generated outline structure
- [ ] Ensure proper hierarchy handling (2-level vs 3-level)

### Phase 3: Formatting Updates
- [ ] Update WordPress formatting functions for hierarchical structure
- [ ] Update Markdown formatting functions for hierarchical structure
- [ ] Ensure proper heading levels (h2 for sections, h3 for subsections, h4 for paragraph headings if needed)

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Ensure CSV workflow integrates seamlessly with new hierarchical structure
- [ ] Test both 2-level and 3-level scenarios with CSV input

The main difference from Script 1 is that Script 2 starts with CSV-provided section titles and then generates the rest of the structure dynamically, while Script 1 generates everything from scratch.

Should I proceed with implementing these changes in Script 2?
