# Grammar Tool Functionality Issues in Script 2

This development log documents the plan to investigate and fix the grammar tool functionality in Script 2 of the CopyscriptAI project.

## Overview

The grammar checking feature in Script 2 is currently disabled due to functionality issues. According to the to-do list, this is a **HIGH** priority issue that needs to be addressed. Unlike Script 1 where the grammar checking works properly, Script 2's implementation has problems that need investigation and fixing.

## Current Status Analysis

Based on the initial information:

- The grammar tool in Script 2 is supposed to instruct the LLM to process each section of an article for grammar improvements
- The feature is currently disabled (likely due to issues that weren't fully documented)
- There's limited documentation about whether the feature itself is failing or causing other issues in the article generation process
- Script 1's grammar checking functionality works correctly and can serve as a reference

## Investigation Plan

### 1. Code Analysis

‚úÖ **Task 1.1**: Analyze Script 2's grammar checking implementation
- Review the `check_grammar` function in Script 2's text_processor.py
- Compare with Script 1's implementation to identify differences
- Check how grammar checking is integrated into the article generation workflow
- Review error handling around grammar checking

‚úÖ **Task 1.2**: Analyze configuration parameters
- Check how grammar checking is enabled/disabled in configuration
- Review grammar-related parameters in config.py
- Check for any parameters that might be missing or misconfigured

‚úÖ **Task 1.3**: Analyze integration with OpenRouter

## Technical Approach Details

### Potential Issues and Solutions

Based on common issues with LLM-based grammar checking, here are some potential problems and solutions to investigate:

1. **Token Management Issues**
   - Problem: Grammar checking may exceed token limits for large sections
   - Solution: Implement chunking for grammar checking of large content

2. **API Integration Issues**
   - Problem: Grammar checking may not properly use OpenRouter
   - Solution: Ensure API routing logic is consistent with other features

3. **Formatting Loss**
   - Problem: Grammar checking may strip important formatting
   - Solution: Preserve formatting or re-apply it after grammar checking

4. **Context Window Management**
   - Problem: Grammar checking may use too much of the context window
   - Solution: Optimize prompt design or implement independent calls

5. **Order of Operations**
   - Problem: Grammar checking may be applied in the wrong sequence
   - Solution: Ensure proper sequencing, especially with humanization

### Implementation Strategies

Depending on the root cause, implementation strategies might include:

1. **Port Script 1's Implementation**
   - If Script 1's grammar checking works well, adapt that implementation for Script 2
   - Ensure compatibility with Script 2's architecture

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add specific retry logic for grammar checking
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when grammar checking fails

3. **Optimize Prompts**
   - Redesign grammar checking prompts to be more efficient
   - Ensure prompts clearly instruct the LLM to preserve formatting

4. **Content Chunking**
   - Implement chunking strategies for grammar checking of large sections
   - Process chunks independently and recombine

## Notes and Observations

### Analysis of Grammar Tool Issue (Script 2)

**Date**: May 30, 2025

**Root Cause Identified**: 
The grammar tool failure in Script 2 is caused by API rate limiting issues with OpenRouter, specifically when using free tier models. The RetryError occurs because the retry mechanism exhausts all attempts when hitting rate limits repeatedly.

**Key Findings from Log Analysis**:

1. **Rate Limit Errors**: The logs show multiple `429 - Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-min` errors from OpenRouter API
2. **Retry Exhaustion**: The retry mechanism (configured with 3 attempts, exponential backoff) fails after all attempts are exhausted
3. **Model Used**: `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` - free tier model with strict rate limits
4. **Error Pattern**: `RetryError[<Future at 0x7f4cc5f90590 state=finished raised HTTPError>]`

**Comparison with Script 1**:
- Script 1 has similar grammar checking logic but may have different rate limiting configurations
- Both scripts use the same underlying `tenacity` retry decorator pattern
- The issue appears to be environmental rather than implementation-specific

**Technical Issues Identified**:

1. **Insufficient Rate Limit Handling**: 
   - Current retry strategy doesn't account for OpenRouter's free tier limitations
   - No exponential backoff specific to rate limiting scenarios
   - Missing fallback mechanisms when rate limits are consistently hit

2. **Token Management**:
   - Grammar checking generates multiple API calls in sequence
   - Each article section triggers separate grammar check calls
   - Accumulating API calls quickly exhaust rate limits

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - RetryError is not caught and handled gracefully
   - No fallback to original text when grammar checking fails completely

**Immediate Solutions Recommended**:

1. **Enhanced Rate Limit Handling**:
   - Implement longer delays for rate limit errors (20+ seconds)
   - Add specific handling for 429 errors vs other API errors
   - Consider switching to paid OpenRouter tier or different model

2. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Catch RetryError and return original text with warning
   - Add configuration option to disable grammar checking when rate limits hit
   - Implement batching or queuing for grammar check requests

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Consider processing multiple text segments in single API call
   - Implement local grammar checking as fallback
   - Add option to skip grammar checking for non-critical content

**Status**: ‚úÖ Issue fixed. Solutions implemented and tested successfully.

### Implementation Details

**Date**: May 30, 2025

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Custom Retry Logic with Enhanced Rate Limit Handling**:
   - Replaced the `tenacity` retry decorator with a custom implementation
   - Added longer delays specifically for rate limit errors (starting at 20 seconds)
   - Implemented exponential backoff with doubling delay times between retries
   - Added specific handling for HTTP 429 errors vs other API errors
   - Limited maximum retries to 3 with configuration option

2. **Improved OpenRouter API Call Implementation**:
   - Enhanced error detection for rate limit errors in API responses
   - Added detailed logging of rate limit information
   - Implemented specific handling for free tier limitations
   - Improved error propagation to calling functions

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Added fallback to return original text after maximum retries
   - Implemented warning logs when falling back to original text
   - Added configuration options to control retry behavior

4. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Added new configuration parameters for grammar check rate limiting:
     - `grammar_rate_limit_max_retries`: Maximum retries for rate limit errors
     - `grammar_rate_limit_initial_delay`: Initial delay in seconds
     - `grammar_disable_on_rate_limit`: Option to disable grammar checking after repeated rate limits
   - Enabled grammar checking by default

## OpenRouter Rate Limit Handling Improvement

While working on the grammar tool fixes, we identified another critical issue that affected all OpenRouter API interactions: the handling of free tier rate limits. This issue needed to be resolved to ensure reliable operation of the grammar tool and other API-dependent features.

### Issue Analysis

1. **Rate Limit Errors**: The logs show multiple `429 - Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-min` errors from OpenRouter API
2. **Current Handling**: The code wasn't properly handling these rate limits, causing process interruptions
3. **Impact**: This affected all features using OpenRouter API, including the grammar checking tool
4. **Required Fix**: Implementation of proper rate limit detection, waiting, and retry mechanism

### Implementation

I've implemented a comprehensive solution to handle OpenRouter's free tier minute-based rate limits in both script1 and script2:

1. **Enhanced Rate Limit Error Handling**:
   - Created/enhanced a custom `RateLimitError` class in both scripts with properties to distinguish between different types of rate limits
   - Added specific detection for "free-models-per-min" rate limits in API responses
   - Implemented appropriate waiting times based on the type of rate limit (65+ seconds for minute-based limits)

2. **Script1 Implementation**:
   - Created a new `rate_limit_error.py` file with the custom exception class
   - Updated `make_openrouter_api_call` to detect and properly handle rate limit errors
   - Enhanced `gpt_completion` to implement automatic waiting and retrying

3. **Script2 Implementation**:
   - Enhanced the existing `RateLimitError` class with additional properties
   - Updated rate limit detection in `make_openrouter_api_call`
   - Improved error handling in `generate_completion` to implement smart waiting and retry logic

4. **Benefits**:
   - Seamless process continuation when free tier rate limits are hit
   - Optimal waiting periods (65 seconds for minute-based limits, shorter for other rate limits)
   - Comprehensive handling across both scripts
   - Improved reliability for all OpenRouter API interactions, including grammar checking

5. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created test script `test_grammar_fix.py` to verify fixes
   - Implemented test cases with intentional grammar errors
   - Added test for rate limit handling behavior

**Testing Results**:

The implemented solutions have been tested with the following results:
- Grammar checking now works reliably with OpenRouter free tier models
- Rate limit errors are handled properly with appropriate delays
- After maximum retries, the system gracefully returns the original text
- Configuration options allow for fine-tuning of retry behavior
- No negative impact on other features when grammar checking is enabled

**Documentation**:

Comprehensive documentation has been created in:
- `/home/abuh/Documents/Python/LLM_article_gen_2/scripts/script2/docs/grammar_tool_fix_report.md`

The documentation includes details about the implemented solutions, configuration options, and recommendations for further improvements.
