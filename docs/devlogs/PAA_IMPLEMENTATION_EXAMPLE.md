# PAA Multi-Paragraph Implementation Example

This document provides a specific implementation example showing the exact code changes needed to implement the multi-paragraph PAA answers feature for `script2`. This can be used as a reference when making the actual code changes.

## Example Implementation for script2

### 1. Changes to prompts.py

```python
# Before:
PAA_ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are writing an answer for a "People Also Ask" section in an article about "{keyword}".
The question is: "{question}"

Write a concise, informative paragraph that directly answers this question.
The answer should be helpful, accurate, and provide value to the reader.
Keep the answer to a single paragraph with about 100-150 words.

Remember to:
- Be direct and answer the question clearly
- Include relevant facts or details
- Write in a natural, engaging style
- Maintain the context of the main article topic: "{keyword}"
- Adjust tone to match: {tone}
- Use appropriate language: {language}
- Target audience expertise level: {audience}
- Use appropriate {pov} point of view
- NO color or extra formatting other than just strong, and em.
"""

# After:
PAA_ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are writing an answer for a "People Also Ask" section in an article about "{keyword}".
The question is: "{question}"

Write a concise, informative answer that directly addresses this question.
The answer should be structured into {paragraphs_per_section} paragraphs.
Each paragraph should flow naturally and provide value to the reader.
Total length should be about {paragraphs_per_section * 120} words.

Remember to:
- Be direct and answer the question clearly
- Include relevant facts or details
- Write in a natural, engaging style
- Maintain the context of the main article topic: "{keyword}"
- Adjust tone to match: {tone}
- Use appropriate language: {language}
- Target audience expertise level: {audience}
- Use appropriate {pov} point of view
- Ensure a logical flow between paragraphs
- NO color or extra formatting other than just strong, and em.
"""
```

### 2. Changes to article_generator/paa_handler.py

```python

## Test Case Example

Here's a simple test case that can be used to verify the implementation:

```python
def test_paa_multi_paragraph_answers():
    """Test generating PAA answers with multiple paragraphs."""
    # Initialize configuration
    config = Config()
    config.paragraphs_per_section = 3  # Set to generate 3 paragraphs
    
    # Initialize PAA handler
    paa_handler = PAAHandler(config)
    
    # Test question
    question = "What are the benefits of regular exercise?"
    keyword = "healthy lifestyle"
    
    # Generate answer
    answer = paa_handler.generate_answer_for_question(question, keyword)
    
    # Check result
    paragraphs = answer.split("\n\n")
    assert len(paragraphs) == 3, f"Expected 3 paragraphs, got {len(paragraphs)}"
    
    # Verify each paragraph has reasonable content
    for i, paragraph in enumerate(paragraphs):
        assert len(paragraph.split()) >= 30, f"Paragraph {i+1} too short: {len(paragraph.split())} words"
        assert len(paragraph.split()) <= 200, f"Paragraph {i+1} too long: {len(paragraph.split())} words"
    
    print(f"âœ… PAA multi-paragraph test passed with {len(paragraphs)} paragraphs")
    print(f"Total word count: {len(answer.split())}")
    return True
```

This implementation preserves all existing functionality while adding the ability to generate multiple paragraphs for PAA answers that match the article's configured paragraph style.
