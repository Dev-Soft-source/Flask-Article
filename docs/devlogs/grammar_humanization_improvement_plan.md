# Development Log: Grammar and Humanization Process Improvements

## Overview

This development log outlines the technical plan for enhancing the grammar checking and humanization processes in our article generation system. The improvements focus on making these processes more selective and paragraph-based rather than applying them to entire sections at once.

## Current Implementation Analysis

Currently, both grammar checking and humanization are applied to entire sections of content at once, which has the following issues:

1. Headings are processed along with content, potentially changing their structure
2. Entire sections are processed as a single unit rather than paragraph by paragraph
3. Special content like summaries, block notes/key takeaways are being processed unnecessarily

## Technical Requirements

We need to implement the following changes:

1. Exclude headings from grammar checking and humanization processes
2. Process content paragraph by paragraph instead of whole sections
3. Exclude specific content types (summaries, titles, block notes/key takeaways) from both processes

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Modify Grammar Checking in `_check_grammar` Method

#### File: `/home/abuh/Documents/Python/LLM_article_gen_2/scripts/script2/article_generator/generator.py`

We need to modify the sections grammar checking to:
- Split sections into paragraphs
- Process each paragraph individually
- Preserve headings without modification
- Skip processing summaries and block notes

```python
# Process sections paragraph by paragraph
if 'sections' in article_components and article_components['sections']:
    provider.info("Checking grammar for sections...")
    for i, section in enumerate(article_components['sections']):
        if section:
            # Split the section into paragraphs
            paragraphs = section.split('\n\n')
            processed_paragraphs = []
            
            for paragraph in paragraphs:
                paragraph = paragraph.strip()
                if not paragraph:
                    processed_paragraphs.append("")
                    continue
                
                # Skip headings (lines starting with #, ##, ###)
                if paragraph.startswith('#'):
                    processed_paragraphs.append(paragraph)
                    continue
                
                # Process regular paragraph content
                processed_paragraph = check_grammar(
                    context,
                    paragraph,
                    self.prompts.grammar,
                    engine=self.config.openai_model,
                    enable_token_tracking=self.config.enable_token_tracking,
                    track_token_usage=self.config.enable_token_tracking,
                    content_type=f"Section {i+1} paragraph"
                )
                processed_paragraphs.append(processed_paragraph)
            
            # Recombine the paragraphs
            article_components['sections'][i] = '\n\n'.join(processed_paragraphs)
```

### 2. Modify Text Humanization in `_humanize_text` Method

#### File: `/home/abuh/Documents/Python/LLM_article_gen_2/scripts/script2/article_generator/generator.py`

Similar changes for the humanization process:
- Split sections into paragraphs
- Process each paragraph individually
- Preserve headings without modification
- Skip processing summaries and block notes

```python
# Humanize sections paragraph by paragraph
if 'sections' in article_components and article_components['sections']:
    provider.info("Humanizing sections...")
    for i, section in enumerate(article_components['sections']):
        if section:
            # Split the section into paragraphs
            paragraphs = section.split('\n\n')
            processed_paragraphs = []
            
            for paragraph in paragraphs:
                paragraph = paragraph.strip()
                if not paragraph:
                    processed_paragraphs.append("")
                    continue
                
                # Skip headings (lines starting with #, ##, ###)
                if paragraph.startswith('#'):
                    processed_paragraphs.append(paragraph)
                    continue
                
                # Process regular paragraph content
                processed_paragraph = humanize_text(
                    context,
                    paragraph,
                    self.prompts.humanize,
                    engine=self.config.openai_model,
                    enable_token_tracking=self.config.enable_token_tracking,
                    track_token_usage=self.config.enable_token_tracking,
                    content_type=f"Section {i+1} paragraph"
                )
                processed_paragraphs.append(processed_paragraph)
            
            # Recombine the paragraphs
            article_components['sections'][i] = '\n\n'.join(processed_paragraphs)
```

### 3. Skip Summary and Block Notes Processing

#### For both functions

Add conditional checks to skip processing summary and block notes:

```python
# Skip summary if present
if 'summary' in article_components and article_components['summary']:
    provider.info("Skipping grammar check for summary...")
    # No processing needed, keep as is

# Skip block notes if present
if 'block_notes' in article_components and article_components['block_notes']:
    provider.info("Skipping grammar check for block notes...")
    # No processing needed, keep as is
```

## Testing Plan

1. Create test articles with various content types
2. Verify headings remain unchanged after processing
3. Verify paragraphs are processed individually
4. Verify summary and block notes are preserved exactly as generated
5. Check overall article quality after selective processing

## Todo List

- [x] Update `_check_grammar` method to process paragraphs individually
- [x] Update `_humanize_text` method to process paragraphs individually
- [x] Add logic to exclude headings from processing
- [x] Add logic to skip summary content
- [x] Add logic to skip block notes/key takeaways
- [ ] Create test cases to verify the new implementation
- [ ] Run test articles through the updated process
- [x] Document the changes in code comments

## Expected Benefits

1. Improved structural integrity of the article
2. Better preservation of headings and formatting
3. More focused processing of actual content
4. Reduced token usage by avoiding unnecessary processing
5. Better handling of special content sections

## Future Considerations

We may want to extend this selective processing approach to other content generation functions in the future, applying a more granular approach to all text processing operations.
