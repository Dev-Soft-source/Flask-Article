# PAA (People Also Ask) Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure and use the enhanced PAA (People Also Ask) functionality in CopyscriptAI.

## Overview

The PAA feature automatically fetches related questions from Google's "People Also Ask" section and generates AI-powered answers for your articles. This creates valuable, SEO-friendly content that addresses common user queries.

## New Configuration Options

### PAA Settings

The following parameters can be configured in your script's configuration:

#### `paa_max_questions` (integer, default: 5)
Sets the maximum number of PAA questions to include in your article.

**Example:**
```python
paa_max_questions: int = 8  # Include up to 8 PAA questions
```

#### `paa_min_questions` (integer, default: 3)
Sets the minimum number of PAA questions when using random range mode.

**Example:**
```python
paa_min_questions: int = 2  # At least 2 PAA questions
```

#### `paa_use_random_range` (boolean, default: False)
When enabled, the system will randomly select between `paa_min_questions` and `paa_max_questions` for each article.

**Example:**
```python
paa_use_random_range: bool = True  # Use random range
```

## Usage Examples

### Fixed Number of Questions
```python
# Configuration for exactly 5 PAA questions per article
paa_max_questions: int = 5
paa_min_questions: int = 3  # Ignored when random range is disabled
paa_use_random_range: bool = False
```

### Random Range of Questions
```python
# Configuration for 3-7 PAA questions per article (randomly selected)
paa_max_questions: int = 7
paa_min_questions: int = 3
paa_use_random_range: bool = True
```

### Conservative Settings (Fewer Questions)
```python
# Configuration for 1-3 PAA questions per article
paa_max_questions: int = 3
paa_min_questions: int = 1
paa_use_random_range: bool = True
```

### Aggressive Settings (More Questions)
```python
# Configuration for exactly 10 PAA questions per article
paa_max_questions: int = 10
paa_min_questions: int = 5  # Ignored when random range is disabled
paa_use_random_range: bool = False
```

## How It Works

1. **Question Fetching**: The system uses SerpAPI to fetch related questions from Google's "People Also Ask" section based on your article keyword.

2. **Question Selection**: 
   - If `paa_use_random_range` is `False`: Uses exactly `paa_max_questions` questions
   - If `paa_use_random_range` is `True`: Randomly selects between `paa_min_questions` and `paa_max_questions`

3. **Answer Generation**: For each selected question, the AI generates a comprehensive, contextual answer using your article's content and web context.

4. **Formatting**: Questions and answers are formatted as a markdown section with proper headings.

5. **Humanization**: If text humanization is enabled, only the answer content is humanized while preserving the question headings and structure.

## Troubleshooting

### No PAA Questions Generated
- **Check SerpAPI Key**: Ensure your SerpAPI key is valid and has remaining credits
- **Verify Keyword**: Some keywords may not have PAA questions available
- **Check Configuration**: Ensure `add_PAA_paragraphs_into_article` is set to `True`

### Questions Not Displaying Properly
- **Humanization Settings**: If using Script 2, the new humanization fix should preserve question headings
- **WordPress Formatting**: Check that your WordPress theme supports markdown headings

### API Rate Limits
- **Reduce Frequency**: Lower `paa_max_questions` to reduce API calls
- **Use Caching**: The system automatically caches PAA questions for 24 hours
- **Multiple Keys**: Configure multiple SerpAPI keys for higher limits

## Migration from Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Add New Parameters**: Add the three new PAA parameters to your configuration
2. **Keep Existing Settings**: Your existing `add_PAA_paragraphs_into_article` setting will continue to work
3. **Test Configuration**: Run a test article to verify the new settings work as expected

## Important Notes About Content Structure Preservation

### Humanization and Structure Integrity

**CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT**: As of May 30, 2025, both PAA and FAQ sections now properly preserve their structure during the humanization process.

#### Previous Issue
When humanization was enabled, both PAA and FAQ sections were being processed wholesale, which destroyed their structural formatting:
- PAA questions lost their markdown headings
- FAQ questions lost their Q:/A: markers (Script 1) or WordPress block formatting (Script 2)

#### Current Solution
Both scripts now use intelligent line-by-line parsing during humanization:

**PAA Sections:**
- Preserve markdown headers (`##`, `###`)
- Only humanize answer paragraphs
- Maintain proper question structure

**FAQ Sections:**
- **Script 1**: Preserve Q:/A: markers, only humanize answer content
- **Script 2**: Preserve WordPress block structure, only humanize paragraph content

#### What This Means for Users
- ✅ PAA and FAQ sections maintain proper formatting
- ✅ Questions remain clearly structured and readable  
- ✅ Better SEO value from properly formatted headings
- ✅ Improved user experience with clear Q&A structure
- ✅ WordPress compatibility maintained for Script 2

#### Verification
To verify your FAQ and PAA sections are properly structured after humanization:

1. **Check PAA sections** for proper markdown headings:
   ```markdown
   ## People Also Ask
   
   ### What are the main benefits of...?
   [Humanized answer content]
   
   ### How can I ensure my cat...?
   [Humanized answer content]
   ```

2. **Check FAQ sections**:
   - **Script 1**: Look for preserved Q:/A: format
   - **Script 2**: Verify WordPress blocks are intact

If you notice any structural issues, please check your configuration and consider running the test suites provided in the repository.

## Multi-Paragraph PAA Answers

### Overview
PAA answers now support multiple paragraphs that match your article's section formatting. This provides several benefits:

1. **Consistent Formatting**: PAA answers follow the same paragraph structure as the rest of your article
2. **Better Readability**: Multi-paragraph answers improve content flow and readability
3. **Enhanced SEO**: Properly structured content is better for search engine optimization
4. **More Comprehensive Answers**: Multiple paragraphs allow for more detailed responses

### How It Works

The system automatically formats PAA answers to match your article's paragraph configuration:

- PAA answers now use the same `paragraphs_per_section` setting as the main article content
- Each paragraph is structured to follow a logical flow (introduction, details, conclusion)
- Total word count scales with the number of paragraphs

### Configuration

No additional configuration is needed. The PAA answers will automatically use the `paragraphs_per_section` value from your main configuration:

```python
# This setting affects both article sections AND PAA answers
paragraphs_per_section: int = 3  # Both article sections and PAA answers will have 3 paragraphs
```

### Examples

#### Single Paragraph Setting
```python
paragraphs_per_section: int = 1

# Result:
## How do I train my dog?
[Single paragraph answer about dog training techniques]
```

#### Two Paragraph Setting
```python
paragraphs_per_section: int = 2

# Result:
## How do I train my dog?
[First paragraph introducing basic dog training principles]

[Second paragraph with more specific training techniques and recommendations]
```

#### Three Paragraph Setting
```python
paragraphs_per_section: int = 3

# Result:
## How do I train my dog?
[First paragraph introducing dog training concepts]

[Second paragraph explaining specific training methods]

[Third paragraph with advanced tips and conclusion]
```

### Best Practices

- **Match Content Type**: Use more paragraphs for complex topics that need detailed explanations
- **Consider Answer Length**: More paragraphs result in longer PAA answers (each paragraph is ~100 words)
- **Balance with Question Count**: When using more paragraphs per answer, consider using fewer questions to maintain reasonable article length
- **Maintain Readability**: While 3-4 paragraphs can work well for detailed answers, very long answers (5+ paragraphs) may become unwieldy

### Technical Details

- Each paragraph is approximately 80-120 words
- Total word count scales linearly with paragraph count
- The system generates different content structures based on paragraph count:
  - 1 paragraph: Direct, concise answer
  - 2 paragraphs: Introduction + details
  - 3+ paragraphs: Introduction, multiple detail paragraphs, conclusion
