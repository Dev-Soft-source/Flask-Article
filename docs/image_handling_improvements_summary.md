# Image Handling Improvements Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the image handling improvements implemented in CopyscriptAI.

## Overview of Changes

The following features have been successfully implemented in both script1 and script2:

1. **Image Alignment Options**
   - Added ability to specify image alignment (center, left, right)
   - Implemented as `alignment` parameter in the image config
   - Properly integrated with WordPress formatting
   - Default value is "aligncenter"

2. **Image Compression**
   - Added image compression using PIL/Pillow
   - Implemented quality setting (0-100) with default of 70
   - Compression is optional and disabled by default
   - Added file size optimization logic to preserve image if compression doesn't reduce size

3. **Duplicate Image Prevention**
   - Added option to prevent duplicate images in articles
   - Implemented tracking of used image IDs
   - Skip mechanism for duplicate images when prevention is enabled
   - Default is disabled to maintain backward compatibility

## Configuration

The following configuration options were added to both scripts:

```python
# Image alignment options: "aligncenter", "alignleft", "alignright"
image_alignment: str = "aligncenter"

# Image compression options
enable_image_compression: bool = False
image_compression_quality: int = 70  # 0-100, higher is better quality but larger file size

# Prevent duplicate images in the same article
prevent_duplicate_images: bool = False
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created to verify all implemented features:
- `tests/test_image_improvements.py`

The script includes tests for:
- Image compression with different quality levels
- Image alignment parameter handling
- Duplicate image prevention

## Usage Example

Here's how to use the new features:

```python
from article_generator.image_handler import ImageConfig

# Create image config with custom settings
image_config = ImageConfig(
    enable_image_generation=True,
    randomize_images=True,
    max_number_of_images=5,
    orientation="landscape",
    
    # New options
    alignment="alignright",  # Right-align images
    enable_image_compression=True,  # Enable compression
    compression_quality=60,  # Set quality level (lower = smaller file size)
    prevent_duplicate_images=True  # Prevent duplicates
)

# Get article images with the config
feature_image, body_images = get_article_images(
    keyword="example keyword",
    config=image_config
)
```

## Files Modified

The following files were modified to implement these features:

1. **Script1**
   - `script1/article_generator/image_handler.py`
   - `script1/utils/config.py`
   - `script1/article_generator/text_processor.py`
   - `script1/requirements.txt`

2. **Script2**
   - `script2/article_generator/image_handler.py`
   - `script2/config.py`
   - `script2/article_generator/text_processor.py`

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:
- Add UI controls for image alignment in web interface
- Implement advanced image processing options (resizing, cropping)
- Add support for WebP image format for better compression
- Implement image caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
