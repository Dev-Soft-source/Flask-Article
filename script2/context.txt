Title: Apple iPhone 16 Pro review | Tom's Guide
Content: Tom's Guide Verdict
The iPhone 16 Pro gets a bigger display and the 5x tetraprism zoom from the Max without a price hike. Add in promising Apple Intelligence features, a smarter Siri and longer battery life, and this is a compelling flagship phone value. I just wish the charging speed got a boost and that Visual Intelligence and ChatGPT weren’t coming later.
Pros
- +
Bigger display
- +
Improved battery life
- +
Helpful Camera Control
- +
5x zoom and improved ultra wide camera
- +
Impressive Audio Mix for videos
- +
Better Siri and promising Apple Intelligence features
Cons
- -
Same slow charging speeds (again)
- -
Apple Intelligence a work in progress

Between the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the latter seems like a bigger deal because of its ginormous 6.9-inch screen. But I’m telling you the iPhone 16 Pro should not be overlooked.
I’ve been using both of these new iPhone Pros side by side, and I think the regular iPhone 16 Pro is a better value. For $999, you get a bigger display than last year (6.3 vs 6.1 inches), the more powerful 5x zoom that used to be a Pro Max exclusive and an impressive battery life boost, based on our testing.

Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro has all the same goodies as the Pro Max, including the powerful A18 Pro chip, upgraded 48MP ultra wide camera and impressive video features like 4K 120 fps slow mo videos and Audio Mix for zapping background noise. Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools and the new

Title: Apple iPhone 16 Pro review: pocket-sized brilliance and no concessions | TechRadar
Content: TechRadar Verdict
The Apple iPhone 16 Pro is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made, and if the 16 Pro Max is too big for your tastes then it's the best new iPhone for you, and deserves a spot atop our 'Best phones' list. The screen is slightly larger and still lovely. It packs more power than most people will need in a smartphone and takes beautiful photos. The entire photo and video operation is enhanced by upgraded cameras, new image manipulation tools, and the new Camera Control button. Apple Intelligence is an intriguing addition that's quite useful in some situations but unrealized in others. It's a solid glimpse of what's to come. Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro will be a big leap if you're still using, for instance, an iPhone 12 Pro, but it's not necessarily worth trading in your iPhone 15 Pro.
Pros
- +
Slightly larger and heavier but still compact size
- +
Camera Control button for instant camera access
- +
A18 Pro
- +
Apple Intelligence
Cons
- -
Apple Intelligence leaves you wanting more
- -
Half the storage it should have
- -
Not the sharpest screen in its class

Apple iPhone 16 Pro: Two-minute review
The iPhone 16 Pro is
[Apple](https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple)'s 6.3-inch smartphone for those who think a 6.9-inch screen is overkill. Put another way, the iPhone 16 Po is essentially the same as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, just smaller and lighter. Aside from the storage options starting at a lesser (and not very useful) 128GB, there are no major differences between the two handsets. You could arguably read my iPhone 16 Pro Max review and learn everything you need to know about the iPhone 16 Pro.
Like that larger phone, this iPhone 16 Pro is not a sea change from the iPhone 15 Pro. With the exception of the very welcome 5x optical zoom upgrade (it was on

Title: Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus Review: Why Go Pro? | WIRED
Content: The one overwhelming piece of feedback I've seen about the new
[iPhone 16](https://www.wired.com/story/which-apple-iphone-16-models-to-buy/) is that it looks pretty. The new teal, ultramarine, and pink colors are more vivid than previous ones, thanks to a new manufacturing process, which Apple says infuses color throughout the glass back of the phone. The [iPhone 16 Pro](https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-16-pro-and-iphone-16-pro-max/) colors are boring, and I agree.
There are no sweeping changes to the iPhone 16 over its predecessor. Yes, there's a new Camera Control button, and the Action Button has trickled down from the Pro, but nearly every other part of the device is an iterative upgrade. I've also now been living with
[Apple Intelligence](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-isnt-ready-to-wow-you-yet/) for a few weeks—at least, a beta version of it with some missing features—and it's safe to say that while there are a few features that will be very helpful day-to-day for some folks, it is not a reason to upgrade, especially if [your iPhone](https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/) is functioning fine.
All that said, this iPhone has a beefier battery and a more powerful processor, and
[it](https://www.ifixit.com/News/100352/we-hot-wired-the-iphone-16) [is easier to repair](https://www.ifixit.com/News/100352/we-hot-wired-the-iphone-16). Its cameras are more than capable. Combined with the fact that Face ID is still unrivaled, the Dynamic Island has grown on me, and I'm still waiting for [MagSafe-like charging](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-qi2-wireless-charging/) to make its way to [Android phones](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-android-phones/). It doesn't feel like the iPhone 16 needs much more.
Why Go Pro?
Apple spends a lot of time on prosumer features in its iPhone Pro models, but very few people will use them. ProRes? Log video recording? Academy Color Encoding System? If none of those words matter to you, then there

Title: Apple iPhone 16 Pro review: a small camera update makes a big difference | The Verge
Content: The iPhone 16 Pro is one of the most unfinished products Apple has ever shipped. Almost all of its highlight features will arrive in future software updates that will stretch well into next year before they’re here. That’s big stuff, like the new Apple Intelligence AI features the company says will start slowly arriving in October, and little stuff, like the complete functionality of the new Camera Control button on the side.
Even really minor things, like that new Siri animation that inspired the tagline “It’s Glowtime” for the phone’s launch event? Not here yet. You get the same old Siri bubble as ever until Apple Intelligence arrives.
The Good
- New tone control in camera lets you dial back HDR processing
- Who doesn’t love a physical shutter button?
- Your video director friends will spend hours gleefully taking 4K120 video portraits of people at street festivals
The Bad
- Camera Control button is a little fiddly
- Default photo processing is more aggressive than ever
- The most incremental of incremental upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro

- The most incremental of incremental upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro
The hard rule of reviews at The Verge is that we always review what’s in the box — the thing you can buy right now. We never review products based on potential or the promise of software updates to come, even if a company is putting up billboards advertising those features, and even if people are
